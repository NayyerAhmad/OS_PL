# Introduction

This project is a web application that helps users add programming languages and operating systems with the ultimate goal of finding out the compatibility of different operating systems and programming languages. It is built using React for the front-end, Express for the server-side, and MySQL for the database.

## Tech Stack

- React
- Express
- MySQL
- Material-UI

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system\

- Visual Studio Code


## How to run the project

1. Clone the repository from Github.\

2. Open the terminal and navigate to the main directory of the project.\

3. Run the command "npm install" to install the necessary dependencies.\

4. Navigate to the "api" directory and run the command "node index.js". This should start the server on port 3001.\

5. Go back to the main directory and run the command "npm start". This should start the front-end on port 3000.\

6. Open a web browser and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/" to view the application.

## Learning Outcomes

During the development of this project, I learned and revised the following core concepts:

1. Writing API from sratch and confirming its functionality via Postman

2. React Hooks: I used React Hooks, specifically useState and useEffect, to manage component state and to trigger fetching of data from an API when the component mounts.

3. Fetching data from an API: Used the fetch function to retrieve data from APIs.

4. Custom components: Building custom components based on the project needs

## Conclusion

In summary, this project is a web application built using React, Express, and MySQL. I used React Hooks, the fetch function, Material-UI, custom components, and event handling to create a user-friendly interface for finding the compatibility of different operating systems and programming languages. By following the steps mentioned above, users can easily run the project on their local machines and explore the codebase.
