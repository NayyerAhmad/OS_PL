# Introduction

This project is a web application that helps users add programming languages and operating systems with the ultimate goal of finding out the compatibility of different operating systems and programming languages. It is built using React for the front-end, Express for the server-side, and MySQL for the database.

## Learning Outcomes

During the development of this project, I learned and revised the following core concepts:

React Hooks: We used React Hooks, specifically useState and useEffect, to manage component state and to trigger fetching of data from an API when the component mounts.

Fetching data from an API: Used the fetch function to retrieve data from APIs.

Custom components: Building custom components based on the project needs
